## About

A landing page generator for indie game developers.  

This simplifies the process, so that the indie game developers can focus on making videogames instead of coding a webpage.

### Who made this?

We are Team-Sunset, a ragtag bunch of software developers, web developers, designers, and game developers who are gamers at heart.  All of us met each other during the Tool Jam 2016 hackathon.  Our team name came about, because as we were registering, the first thing that we saw was someone playing *Sunset Overdrive* in the TV in front of us.
